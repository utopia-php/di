Utopia DI library is simple and lite library for managing dependency injections. This library is aiming to be as simple and easy to learn and use. This library is maintained by the [Appwrite team](https://appwrite.io).

Although this library is part of the Utopia Framework project it is dependency free, and can be used as standalone with any other PHP project or framework.

## Getting Started

Install using Composer:

```bash
composer require utopia-php/http
```


```php
require_once __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

use Utopia\DI\Container;

TBD
```

## System Requirements

Utopia HTTP requires PHP 8.1 or later. We recommend using the latest PHP version whenever possible.

## More from Utopia

Our ecosystem supports other thin PHP projects aiming to extend the core PHP Utopia HTTP.

Each project is focused on solving a single, very simple problem and you can use composer to include any of them in your next project.

You can find all libraries in [GitHub Utopia organization](https://github.com/utopia-php).
