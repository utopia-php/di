Utopia DI is a small PSR-11 compatible dependency injection container with parent-child scopes. It is designed to stay simple while still covering the dependency lifecycle used across the Utopia libraries. This library is maintained by the [Appwrite team](https://appwrite.io).

Although this library is part of the Utopia Framework project it is dependency free, and can be used as standalone with any other PHP project or framework.

## Getting Started

Install using Composer:

```bash
composer require utopia-php/di
```

```php
require_once __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

use Psr\Container\ContainerInterface;
use Utopia\DI\Container;
use Utopia\DI\Dependency;

$di = new Container();

$di->set(
    key: 'age',
    factory: new Dependency(
        injections: [],
        callback: fn () => 25
    )
);

$di->set(
    key: 'john',
    factory: new Dependency(
        injections: ['age'],
        callback: fn (int $age) => 'John Doe is '.$age.' years old.'
    )
);

$john = $di->get('john');
```

For `Dependency` factories, the `injections` array is matched to callback parameter names, so the array order does not need to mirror the callback signature.

You can still register plain factories directly when you want access to the container instance.

```php
$di->set(
    key: 'config',
    factory: fn (ContainerInterface $container) => [
        'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=app',
        'username' => 'root',
        'password' => 'secret',
    ]
);

$request = $di->scope();

$request->set(
    key: 'db',
    factory: fn (ContainerInterface $container) => new PDO(
        $container->get('config')['dsn'],
        $container->get('config')['username'],
        $container->get('config')['password']
    )
);
```

Factories are resolved once per container instance. A child scope behaves in two distinct ways:

- If the child does not define a key, it falls back to the parent and reuses the parent's resolved value.
- If the child defines the same key locally, it resolves and caches its own value without changing the parent.

```php
$counter = 0;

$di->set('requestId', function () use (&$counter): string {
    $counter++;

    return 'request-'.$counter;
});

$di->get('requestId'); // "request-1"

$child = $di->scope();

$child->get('requestId'); // "request-1" (falls back to the parent cache)

$child->set('requestId', function () use (&$counter): string {
    $counter++;

    return 'request-'.$counter;
});

$child->get('requestId'); // "request-2" (child now uses its own local definition)
$di->get('requestId'); // "request-1" (parent is unchanged)
```

## System Requirements

Utopia DI requires PHP 8.2 or later. We recommend using the latest PHP version whenever possible.

## More from Utopia

Our ecosystem supports other thin PHP projects aiming to extend the core PHP Utopia libraries.

Each project is focused on solving a single, very simple problem and you can use composer to include any of them in your next project.

You can find all libraries in [GitHub Utopia organization](https://github.com/utopia-php).
